# Exercise 3

1. For each couleur list item, add a button next to the hexcode. The button label should say "Delete" or "X".

2. When the button is clicked, remove the color from the list. To perform the removal, use the Array filter function.

3. Update the couleur form component to receive an input to customize the button text. Make the default button text "Submit Couleur", but pass in a new value of "Add Couleur" to the form.

4. Ensure it all works!
